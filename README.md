# nextjs-apollo-starter

This starter pack is paired with an [express-node-apollo graphql server](https://github.com/JoeyLyman/express-node-apollo-starter) starter pack to show an implementation of nextjs with apollo.

You can clone that repo and run it locally on port 5000 which is what this starter pack automatically looks for unless you specify SERVER_URI environmental variable.

Creating an account requires a secret code, which will need to be added to the mongodb database.
