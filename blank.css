/* This is probably the same bug as here: #5203
Can be worked around by importing an empty css file from _app.js
It's caused by the chunks having a deferred module dependency on the style chunk, but the style chunk is never loaded, so the new chunk never executes. If you depend on a css file from the _app.js file, then the style chunk will always be available and the new route executes once it's loaded. */
